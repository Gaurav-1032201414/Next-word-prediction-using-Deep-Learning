# 🚀 Next Word Prediction using Deep Learning 🤖
## Overview
Identifying the most likely word to follow a given string of words is a fundamental goal in Natural Language Processing (NLP), crucial for applications like text auto-completion, speech recognition, and machine translation. This repository provides a deep learning-based solution for next-word prediction, leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

## Model Architecture 🏗️
### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 🔄
RNNs process sequential data by maintaining hidden states that capture context and information from previous inputs. However, traditional RNNs face challenges like the vanishing gradient problem.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 🧠
LSTM, a specialized RNN variant, overcomes limitations by introducing a memory cell that selectively stores and retrieves information over long sequences, making it effective in modeling long-term dependencies.

### Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 🤖
GRU simplifies LSTM architecture by merging the cell state and hidden state into a single state vector. It introduces gating mechanisms for efficient information flow while capturing long-term dependencies.

## Model Architecture for Next Word Prediction 📊
The model architecture consists of:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Learns distributed representations of words, capturing semantic and contextual information.
2. **Recurrent Layers (LSTM/GRU)**: Processes input word embeddings sequentially, capturing contextual connections between words.
3. **Dense Layers**: Converts learned features into a probability distribution across the vocabulary for predicting the next word.

## Training and Optimization 🚀
The model is trained using a large text corpus, optimizing parameters through algorithms like Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize categorical cross-entropy loss.

## Inference and Prediction 🚀
Trained models predict the next word by processing input through the learned architecture, outputting a probability distribution across the vocabulary. The word with the highest likelihood is chosen as the predicted next word.
